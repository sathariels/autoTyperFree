# Auto Typer GUI

This is a simple Python GUI application built using Tkinter for automating text typing. The application allows users to input text to be typed, set the typing speed (in words per minute), introduce intentional mistakes, and control the frequency of those mistakes.

## Features:

- **Text Input**: Users can enter the text they want to be typed automatically into the provided text box.
- **Typing Speed**: Users can specify the typing speed in words per minute (WPM) to control the speed at which the text is typed.
- **Intentional Mistakes**: Users can introduce intentional mistakes in the typing process by specifying the number of mistakes and the frequency at which they occur.
- **Start/Stop Typing**: The application provides a button to start and stop the typing process.
  
## How to Use:

1. **Run the Application**: Run the Python script `auto_typer_gui.py`.
2. **Enter Text**: Enter the text you want to be typed automatically into the text box labeled "Enter text to type".
3. **Set Typing Speed**: Enter the desired typing speed in words per minute (WPM) in the "Enter WPM" entry box.
4. **Introduce Mistakes**: Optionally, specify the number of intentional mistakes and their frequency.
5. **Start Typing**: Click the "Start Typing" button to begin the typing process.
6. **Stop Typing**: Click the "Stop Typing" button to stop the typing process at any time.
